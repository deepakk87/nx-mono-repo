# deact

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).
We are trying build react using the material available on the internet.


```
./nx g @nx/js:lib libs/deact --bundler=esbuild
```
## Building

Run `nx build deact` to build the library.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test deact` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Step 1 : - 
Create library `@deepakk87/deact`
Create react application `web-ui` where we will be testing changes.
Render the browser and see the logs in browser console.
Setup is complete.
